# Solid plan

[picture of leds]

It's about time to make something towards growing. Beucase I got some hope.

When I planted the Dundicut pepper, watering every day didn't bring any results for like 3 weeks, so I lost hope a bit, but suddently something started growing from first pot.

So it's time for solid growing starting plan:

I decided to order online seeds of following plants and will decide later which to grow first depending on the space setup in bathroom:

* red basil
* broccoli
* tea - Camelia Sinensis, but because they a lot of time to be usable, so I'll buy seedling
* Salvia oficinalis
* spinachi
* kale
* rucola (a bit too high, but we'll see)


I'll buy all of them at once, and decide later what to plant first.

But for the plants to grow, I need some lighing first. After some research I decided to go with LED, and after extensive research I decided to build a setup with 10 x 1W LED:
* 4 Warm White (3200k)
* 4 Cool white (6500k)  
* 1 Deep Red (660nm)
* 1 Royal Blue(450nm)

around 50W per 3 flowers.

 Spectrum needed is this:

 So I think  this set will be universal for everything. Red and blue for this peak needs and white for whole spectrum.    


For the LED setup, there's some cooling required, I found a great site with DIY setup. So I'll do
