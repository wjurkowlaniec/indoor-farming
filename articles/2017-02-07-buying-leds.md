# Let's go

It's about time to start growing eatable plants. When I planted the Dundicut pepper in December, watering every day didn't bring any results for around  3 weeks. Then out of nowhere:

## Plants
I ordered  online seeds of following vegetables and herbs:
* red basil
* broccoli
* Salvia oficinalis
* spinachi
* kale
* rucola (a bit too high, but we'll see)

I'd also like to grow tea - Camelia Sinensis, but cannot find seedling online. I'll have ot look around local area


## Grow light

 But for the plants to grow, I need some lighing first. After some chaotic research I concluteded that in order to provide light for 3 flowers/pots I need around 50W LED setup with following combination:
* 2 Warm white (3200k) 10W
* 2 Cool white (6500k) 10W  
* 1 Deep red (660nm) 5W
* 1 Royal blue(450nm) 5W


With the ratio of  4:4:1:1. I think  this set will be universal for every plant to grow. Red and blue for 660 and 450 nm and white conbitaion for whole 400-700 nm [spectrum required for photosynthesis].

I decided to go with EPISTAR manufacture. The above set costs around 12 euros in Poland.

For the LED setup, there's some cooling required, I found a great site with DIY setup. I'll have to figure it out, but I'll wait for LED's to arrive.
